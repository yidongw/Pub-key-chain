self-certified public key infrastructure on the blockchain

Components:
+ Email client plugin: Chrome extension for GMail
+ blockchain

Publish:

1. The Client certifies its email address with its public key, the certificate.
2. The Client sends the certificate to the blockchain.
3. The blockchain sends a challenging nonce to that address and posts the nonce to the blockchain.
   Up to N random nodes can send N challenging nonces, and this prevents an attacker from control a single node.
4. The Client signs (nonce + 1) and sends it to the blockchain for each challenging nonce, up to N responses.
5. The Client deletes the challenging email after a response.

Search and verify a public key for an email address:

1. The Client searches the blockchain for the certificate of an email address.
2. The blockchain finds the N response from the address.
3. If the response is found, then the blockchain continues to search for the corresponding challenge.
4. If the challenge is found, then verify the signature is (nonce + 1).
5. If more than N/2 responses are correct, then the certificate is believed to be legitimate.
