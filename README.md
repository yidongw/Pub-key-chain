# hackathon-pub-key-chain

This project is for the development of a Chrome extension that retrieves a Public Key associated with a provided email address.

The emails and their public keys are stored in a block chain format, on multiple unspecified nodes.

The underlying structure uses Etherium for access, written in Javascript using the Web3.js module.
